# Rom Com

### Description
Interactive webpage which allows users to generate random, romantic book covers or
even design a book cover any style of their choosing.



### How it works
Home page load will automatically generate a random romance novel cover. A button click allows users to generate a new random cover. Displayed covers can also be saved, and are viewable on the `View Saved Covers` page.

Want to make your own romance novel cover? You can do that to! Click on `Make your own cover`, import the URL of your favorite romantic image, and complete the input fields. With a click of a button the new cover is generated, and can be saved for later viewing.
